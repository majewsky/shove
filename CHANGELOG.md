# v1.0.0 (TODO)

New features:

- Support webhook events generated by Gitea.

  Gitea webhook events are nearly identical to GitHub events. The only
  difference is that they are signed with HMAC-SHA256 instead of HMAC-SHA1.
  Since the library handles signature validation internally, this change does
  not affect users of the Shove library at all.

# v0.1.0 (2019-02-09)

Initial release.
